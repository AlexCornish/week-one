Not much to report in setting up all the parts for this as nothing went wrong, apart from an unrelated blue screen. 
It's not really related to this course and I couldn't screenshot it, but I googled the error code and determined that it 
was indicative of processor failure. 
Update: Computer is completely dead. Had to borrow one from roommate until the new one arrives.

I don't think I encountered any new terms as I have worked quite a bit with GitHub before. 

The UCLA guide (https://uclalibrary.github.io/slides/tutorial-zotero-intro.html#/) on using Zotero was very helpful in teaching
how to use it as I had practically no clue how to use it initially.

There aren't many failures that could be encountered in this weeks section as it should be very simple if the instructions on the
course website are followed properly. Possibly some error involving the the connection between the Zotero desktop and the web browser
extension could cause a technological failure. Technological failures would be the most likely kind of failures for this week, followed
by human error related failures, which would involve deviating from the instructions, either intentionally through disregarding aspects
or improperly reading them, or unintentionally through misunderstanding them.
