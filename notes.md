I'm not sure if this is where I'm supposed to put the annotations of what I've read here, but here they are. 

Lecture 
- I really like the concept of the productive failure, as it reminds me of the old saying "learn from your mistakes" and something
benefitical can come from a productive failure, which is an opportunity for analysis and reflection to figure out what went wrong
and why it happened. The lessons learned from a productive failure could likely lead to a success if it is used properly. Unfortunately, productive fails aren't really seen as a positive things, moreover they tend to be seen as just another failure. 

- I don't really have much of an idea of what digital history is going into this class. Prior to registering for this class, aside from what could be determined from the phrase "Digital history", I would have probably guessed it was related to the history of "digital" things. 

- Digital silences, seemingly are mostly centered around historically marginalised groups and although there are a number of projects to try and rectify this, these projects only represent a small amount of the work that needs to be done to address the imbalance present along with other systemic issues that also need to be tackled.

- I'm excited to see what can be done with digital history and as I'm a Comp Sci. student, I'm curious to see what could be done with digital history and where it could go if combined with other technologies, both existing and emerging technologies such as Augmented/Virtual Reality and Artificial Intelligence.

Returning Women to the History of Digital History:
- Digital history seems to be a changing field with more inputting being made from minority groups who had previously been shut out by the more privileged groups for various reasons, as mentioned in "Returning women to the history of digital history".
- Points out some of the many problematic aspects of traditional academia, where only the few tend to get recognised for their work and get to reap the rewards of those who helped them who aren't as established as them, through either age disparity and/or structural barriers, that prohibit them from becoming established such as structural sexism. As a part of structured sexism, women get tenured slower then men do, and without having tenure, they have greater difficulty getting a lead role in a digital history project. Typically only the senior roles get to take the credit for the digital history projects and those in senior roles are typically white men as they can get tenure easier and subsequently a senior role in a project, for which they get the bulk of the credit as they lead it. Everyone else involved in the project aside from the senior roles, many of whom are women and/or students and/or minorities get very little recognition.  
Amalia Skarlatou Levi's Twitter Thread:
- However, difficulties occur when creating digital history about historically oppressed groups, as mentioned in Amalia Skarlatou Levi's thread, mainly a lack of primary documents about marginalized groups as less records were made about them by those who oppressed them. 
- That thread also included a number of other interesting examples of the difficulties of digital history, such as working with information that come from an unreliable source, such as the documents from the Historic Archive of the National Police of Guatemala from an era of repression and corruption, where the documents themselves are inaccurate, or at least distorted in some way, which brings to attention the fact that digital historians must be as careful as non-digital historians in determining the origins and bias of a primary document and bring that to the attention of those who will use it.
