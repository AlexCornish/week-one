- I really like the concept of the productive failure, as it reminds me of the old saying "learn from your mistakes" and something
benefitical can come from a productive failure, which is an opportunity for analysis and reflection to figure out what went wrong
and why it happened. The lessons learned from a productive failure could likely lead to a success if it is used properly. 

- I don't really have much of an idea of what digital history is going into this class. Prior to registering for this class, aside from
what could be determined from the phrase "Digital history", I would have probably guessed it was related to the history of "digital" 
things. 

- Digital history seems to be a changing field with more inputting being made from minority groups who had previously been shut out
by the more privileged groups for various reasons, as mentioned in "Returning women to the history of digital history".
